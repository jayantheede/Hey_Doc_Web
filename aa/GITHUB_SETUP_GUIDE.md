# 🚀 GitHub Setup Guide - Aastha Homoeo Clinic

## 📋 Current Situation
Git was installed but needs a system restart to be available in new command prompts.

## 🎯 Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: System Restart (Recommended)
1. **Save all your work**
2. **Restart your computer**
3. **Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell**
4. **Navigate to your project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\Jayanth\Desktop\aa
   ```
5. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   setup_github.bat
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Git Commands (After Restart)
If you prefer to run commands manually:

```bash
# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Aastha Homoeo Clinic Hospital Management System"

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/jayantheede/Hey_Doc_Web.git

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: GitHub Desktop (Alternative)
1. **Download GitHub Desktop** from https://desktop.github.com/
2. **Install and sign in** with your GitHub account
3. **Add local repository** - point to your project folder
4. **Publish repository** to GitHub

### Option 4: GitHub Web Interface
1. **Go to** https://github.com/jayantheede/Hey_Doc_Web
2. **Create the repository** if it doesn't exist
3. **Upload files** using the web interface
4. **Or use GitHub CLI** if available

## 🔧 What Will Be Uploaded

Your repository will include these files:
- ✅ `app.py` - Main Flask application
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies  
- ✅ `wsgi.py` - Production server entry point
- ✅ `Procfile` - Heroku deployment configuration
- ✅ `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- ✅ `README.md` - Complete project documentation
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment instructions
- ✅ `deploy.bat` & `deploy.sh` - Deployment scripts
- ✅ `setup_github.bat` & `setup_github.ps1` - GitHub setup scripts
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Excludes unnecessary files

## 🌐 After GitHub Setup

Once your code is on GitHub:

### 1. Visit Your Repository
- **URL**: https://github.com/jayantheede/Hey_Doc_Web

## 📌 Public URL Information

Currently, your Flask application is only running locally on your computer at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (as shown in the logs), which is not accessible from the internet.

To get a public URL, you need to deploy your application to a cloud platform. Let me help you set up deployment options:

## 📌 Deployment Options for Public URL

### **Option 1: Railway (Recommended - Easiest)**
1. **Go to** https://railway.app/
2. **Sign up** with your GitHub account
3. **Connect your repository** (after you push to GitHub)
4. **Deploy automatically** - Railway will give you a public URL like:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.railway.app
   ```

### **Option 2: Render (Free Tier)**
1. **Go to** https://render.com/
2. **Create a new Web Service**
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Get a public URL** like:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.onrender.com
   ```

### **Option 3: Heroku**
1. **Follow the deployment guide** I created
2. **Get a public URL** like:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com
   ```

## 📋 Steps to Get Your Public URL

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub First**
You need to get your code on GitHub first. After restarting your computer, run:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/jayantheede/Hey_Doc_Web.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 2: Deploy to Get Public URL**
Choose one of the platforms above and follow their deployment process.

## 🌐 Your Current Status

- ✅ **Local URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (working on your computer)
- ❌ **Public URL**: Not available yet (needs deployment)
- ✅ **Code**: Ready for deployment
- ✅ **Database**: Connected to MongoDB Atlas

## 🎯 Quickest Way to Get Public URL

1. **Restart your computer** (to make Git available)
2. **Push code to GitHub** (using the commands in `GIT_COMMANDS_TO_RUN.txt`)
3. **Deploy on Railway** (takes 5 minutes)
4. **Get your public URL** immediately
